# Simon-Says-Game:

A fun and challenging memory game where each level tests your ability to recall and replicate a sequence of flashing buttons. The game starts with a single button flashing, and as you progress, additional buttons are added to the sequence. Your task is to remember the entire pattern and press the buttons in the correct order. As the levels increase, the sequences grow longer, pushing your memory to its limits and making the game more engaging and exciting.
